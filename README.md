*Do you have a million bookmarks saved? Do all of those bookmarks contain unique information? Github repos starred for later?*


Well this is a compilation of all of these resources into a single repo known as **Cheatsheet-God**. No more need for bookmarked links. No need to open a web browser. Its all here for you.

This is a collection of resources, scripts and easy to follow how-to's. I have been gathering (and continuing to gather) in preparation for the OSCP as well as for general pentesting. Feel free to use however you want!
